Brother Ethan, Happy Birthday!ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰This is actually going to be wholesome now...
It's truly a blessing that you were brought unto this world to be a friend and inspiration to many. 
I remember my first interaction with you which was when you came up to me to introduce yourself during 
SyBBURE summer 2021, and at the point, I felt that you were someone that cares deeply about others. 
My fondest memories with you were cooking insane dinners with you, and though I can not wake up at 5am, It's 
hella cool to meet someone as active and interested in similar topics. The trips lasts semester
also would not have been the same without you, and I'm super duper excited to go to Mexico with you! May we 
make lasting memories and eat the best tacos over there!
