Here a wholesome story written by yours truly, John:

Ethan sat pensively in gh2 working alone at his favorite desk. Facing away from all distractions that could tear his attention away from his beloved ML PA. The README document warned of strict punishments for deviance, not that Ethan minded. He was going to play along and try his best.
Ethan starts typing away ferociously at the ML PA with lithub flashing to the sound of his keySTROKES. The model failed, but he chuckled under his breathe as he understood that his assignment was teasing him. He grips his ergonomic mouse tight and fingered the scroll wheel, getting deeper and deeper into the doc. He found the spot to satisfy the ML gods. BOOM! the model finished. Sweat poured from Ethans forehead and he laid back on his chair, glad he came to a finish.
