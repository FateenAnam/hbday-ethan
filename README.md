# hbday-ethan
Here ~~an erotica~~ a wholesome story written by yours truly, John:

Ethan sat pensively in gh2 working alone at his favorite desk. Facing away from all distractions that could tear his attention away from his beloved ML PA. The README document warned of strict punishments for deviance, not that Ethan minded. He was going to play along and try his best.
Ethan starts typing away ferociously at the ML PA with lithub flashing to the sound of his keySTROKES. The model failed, but he chuckled under his breathe as he understood that his assignment was teasing him. He grips his ergonomic mouse tight and fingered the scroll wheel, getting deeper and deeper into the doc. He found the spot to satisfy the ML gods. BOOM! the model finished. Sweat poured from Ethans forehead and he laid back on his chair, glad he came to a finish.


Here's a poem written by ~~ChatGPT~~ yours truly, Fateen:

(Verse 1)
Ayy, it's Ethan's birthday, so you know what's going down,
Celebrating a king, the best roommate in this town.
An expert in computer science, machine learning ain't no jest,
When it comes to coding algorithms, Ethan's simply the best.

His Rizz is off the charts, it's out of this sphere,
His humor lights up the room, brings us all some cheer.
Yeah, he's got the discipline, going to bed when it's dark,
Waking up at six, like the early morning lark.

(Chorus)
Ethan Nguyen, he's the man, our machine learning star,
Slaying neural networks, from here to afar.
Helpful and funny, with a discipline so tight,
Happy birthday Ethan, let's celebrate all night.

(Verse 2)
Hit the gym in the morning, always working on his gains,
Got that mental muscle too, always flexing his brains.
In the world of algorithms, he's a savvy sensei,
Got the Python scripts flowing, like the waves in the bay.

A birthday toast to a friend, a roommate, a mentor,
On the road of life, you're a trailblazing inventor.
You're gonna be missed, by everyone, that's true,
But your legacy in our hearts, will always continue.

(Chorus)
Ethan Nguyen, yeah he's setting the pace,
In this vast universe, he's carved his space.
A best friend for life, always kind and so wise,
Happy birthday Ethan, to your future skies.

(Verse 3)
Ethan Nguyen, the perfect teammate, always there to assist,
When it comes to problem-solving, he's got the gist.
From projects to presentations, he's always in his prime,
Even when we're crunching deadlines, he makes it just in time.

An asset to the team, with his wisdom and his wit,
When Ethan's on the project, you know it's gonna be a hit.
His contributions unmeasured, his ideas simply grand,
With Ethan on our side, we always make a stand.

(Chorus)
Ethan Nguyen, more than a mate, a comrade in our quest,
In this digital landscape, he's simply the best.
Working side by side, through each and every phase,
Happy birthday Ethan, here's to our golden days.

(Outro)
So here's to you Ethan, on your special day,
May you keep coding, may you keep leading the way.
You're more than a roommate, you're a brother, a friend,
And on this journey of life, it's love we'll always send.

Happy birthday Ethan, keep being your amazing self,
A titan in the tech world, an incalculable wealth.
From all of us who know you, and those you'll someday meet,
You're an unforgettable character, and knowing you's a treat.
